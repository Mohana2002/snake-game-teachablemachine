# Prototype 

1. As we start there appears a start button.

2. Clicking on start button it asks you to grant permission for camera access.

3. Further it leads to a page where snake game is displayed.

4. The game relies on the sign indicated by the users hand.

5. Corresponding to the motion it consumes the food block and further increases its length.

6. As long as the snake moves in the space provided and doesnot touch itself the game will be continued.
